# Todo

This single-page to-do application features a fluid user interface that, by using JavaScript, allows users to rapidly add dynamic content.

## URL

[https://todo-danny-poit.herokuapp.com/](https://todo-danny-poit.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

Type out a brief description of a task into the top field. For example: "Do laundry". Then hit the `Enter` key, and your task will be added to the list.

To mark a task complete, click the circle next to it. This will place a checkmark in the circle, put a strikethrough on the task, and lighten the font color.

To unmark a task, click the checkmarked circle next to it. This will remove the completed effects from the task.
